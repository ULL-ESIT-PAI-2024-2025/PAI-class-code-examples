  If you click on the <img>, will the toggleVisibility function fire?   
  Yes, a click event set on an element will fire if you click on a child of that element

  If you put a click event listener on the div, and the user clicks on the img inside 
  that div, then the event listener will still fire

      <p>If you put a "click" event listener on an element, what happens if the user clicks a child of that element?</p> 
      <p><b>Example:</b> In this page (see the HTML code) we have an image (img) inside a div, and we put a click event listener on the div.</p>
      <p>If you click on the img, will the toggleVisibility function fire? <p> 
      <p> * Yes, a click event set on an element will fire if you click on a child of that element </p> 
      <p> * In this example we put a click event listener on the div.
        If the user clicks on the img inside that div, then the event listener will still fire

        The exercises proposed as practices are evaluated on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 12:00-14:00h.
        In these sessions, students are proposed programming exercises and the exercise proposed the previous week is reviewed.
        If on any occasion it happens that they cannot attend the practice evaluation session, the following protocol will be followed:
      </p>

      <div class="show-details">   <!-- In JS we set a click event listener on this div -->
        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/1083533/forward-arrow.png" />
        <span>Show details</span>
      </div>

      <div class="details hidden">
        <ul>
          <li>Inform the teacher of the incident in question as soon as possible.</li>
          <li>Be aware that missing a practice does not have to be a problem, since that 
					    grade can be recovered with other grades in the remaining practices. 
							What would be a problem is repeated non-attendance. </li>
          <li>If it is a formally justified reason, you can change your correction session 
					    to the other weekly session: if it is a Wednesday group, you can change to 
							Tuesday and vice versa.</li>
          <li><strong>No changes will be made</strong> to correct practices outside the week 
					    for which they have been planned: each week's practices are evaluated exclusively 
							in the corresponding sessions listed in the course timetable. </li>
